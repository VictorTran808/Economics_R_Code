### Problem 3 

*** 
Consider a bond with a 7% annual coupon and a face value of $1000. Complete the following table:

|Years to Maturity|Years to Maturity | Current Price|
|:---------------:|:----------------:|:------------:|
| 3 | 5 | 1054 |
| 3 | 7 | 1000 |
| 6 | 7 | 1000 |
| 9 | 7 | 1000 |
| 9 | 9 | 880 |

$$\ Current Price (p) = \frac{70}{(1+0.05)^1} + \frac{70}{(1+0.05)^2} + \frac{70}{(1+0.05)^3} + \frac{1000}{(1+0.05)^3} = 1054   $$

$$\ Current Price (p) = \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^1} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^2} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^3} + \frac{1000}{(1+0.07)^3} = 1000   $$

$$\ Current Price (p) = \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^1} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^2} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^3} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^4} +\frac{70}{(1+0.07)^5} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^6} + \frac{1000}{(1+0.07)^6} = 1000   $$
$$\ Current Price (p) = \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^1} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^2} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^3} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^4} +\frac{70}{(1+0.07)^5} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^6} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^7} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^8} + \frac{70}{(1+0.07)^9} + \frac{1000}{(1+0.07)^9} = 1000   $$
$$\ Current Price (p) = \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^1} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^2} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^3} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^4} +\frac{70}{(1+0.09)^5} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^6} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^7} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^8} + \frac{70}{(1+0.09)^9} + \frac{1000}{(1+0.09)^9} = 880   $$
What relationship do you observe between maturity and discount rate and the current price?

First, when the coupon rate = YTM, then the price of the bond = the face value/ current price of the bond.
Second, there is a negative correlation between YTM and bond price. As YTM increase, price decrease.

### Problem 6
***
What is the price of a perpetuity that has a coupon of $50 per year and a yield to maturity (YTM) of 2.5% ? If the YTM doubles, what will happen to its price?

$$\ P_c = \frac{C}{i_C} = \frac{50}{0.025} = 2000 $$
If YTM double, then
$$\ P_c = \frac{C}{i_C} = \frac{50}{0.5} = 1000 $$
This shows that price and YTM are negatively correlated and proportional, since when YTM double, price was reduce by half. 


### Problem 8
***
Suppose that you want to take out a loan and that your local bank wants to charge you an annual real interest rate equal to 3%. Assuming that the annualized expected rate of inflation over the life of the loan is 1%, determine the nominal interest rate that the bank will charge you. What was the actual real interest rate on the loan if, over the life of the loan, actual inflation is 0.5%?

Determining the nominal interest rate:
$$\ i_n = i_r + \Pi^{e} $$ 
$$\ i_n = 0.03 + 0.01 = 0.04 $$
nominal interest rate is 4%

What if the the actual real interest rate on the loan if, over the life of the loan, actual inflation is 0.5% instead of 1%?
$$\ i_n = i_r + \Pi^{e} $$
$$\ 0.04 = i_r + 0.005 $$
$$\ i_r = 0.04 - 0.005 = 0.035  $$
The bank will charge an annualized real interest of 3.5% instead.

### Problem 9
***
Lucia just bought two coupons, one with a face value of 1000, and the other with a face value of 5000. Both bonds have a coupon rate of 5% and sold at par today. Calculate both bonds's current yield and both bond's rate of return if Lucia is able to sell these bond one year late for $100 more than the buying price. Can you estimate what happened to the interest rate over that year?

|Bond |Coupon Rate |Face Value |current Yield |Capital Gain |Rate of Return |Future Bond Price |
|:---:|:----------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------------|:----------------:|
| A | 5% | 1000 | 0.05 | 0.1 | 0.15 | 1100 |
| B | 5% | 5000 | 0.05 | 0.02 | 0.07 | 5100 |

For bond A:
coupon payment = (5% of 1000) = $50
Current yield or $$\ i_c = \frac{50}{1000} = 0.05  $$

Capital gain or $$\ g = \frac{100}{1000} = 0.1 $$

rate of return = $$\ i_c + g = 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 $$
Bond A would provide a rate of return of 15%

For bond B:
coupon payment = (5% of 5000) = $250
Current yield or $$\ i_c = \frac{250}{5000} = 0.05  $$

Capital gain or $$\ g = \frac{100}{5000} = 0.02 $$

rate of return = $$\ i_c + g = 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.07 $$
Bond A would provide a rate of return of 7%


### Problem 10
***
You have paid $980.30 for an 8% coupon with a face value of 1000 that matures in five years. You plan on holding the bond for one year. If you want to earn a 9% rate of return on this investment, what price must you sell the bond for? Is this realistic?

$$\ 0.09 = \frac{80 + x}{1000}$$
$$\ 90 = 80 + x$$
$$\ x = 10$$
$$980.3 + x => 980.3 + 10 = 990.3$$


I would need to sell the bond for at least $990.30 after the 1 year to get a return rate of 9%
